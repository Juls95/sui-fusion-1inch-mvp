Now, advance to UI development and polish, using everything mentioned: official Sui dApp Kit (npm install @mysten/dapp-kit), React for the frontend, integrated with your HTLC contract/scripts, mocked 1inch, and testnet. This creates a complete dApp for interactive demos, improving performance via efficient rendering and onchain calls. Aim for submission readiness by deadline.

1.Implement Stretch Features in Contract and Scripts (Estimated: 4-6 Hours):
Add Fusion+ stubs (e.g., auction params in Escrow struct) and integrate into swap.js for bid simulation.
Importance: Adds novelty (Sui partial fills), differentiating your MVP for prizes by enabling dynamic DeFi (e.g., better liquidity via intents).
Relevance to Use Case: Alice can opt for partial fills during volatile bids, with scripts simulating "Split Swap" options for resilient UX.


2.Build the React dApp UI (Estimated: 8-12 Hours):
In /ui: npx create-react-app sui-demo && npm install @mysten/dapp-kit.
Integrate: Use WalletKit for connect, call your contract via SuiClient in components. Adapt swap.js logic into UI hooks (e.g., useEffect for status polling). Add forms (token selectors, amount inputs), progress bars, and modals for tx views. For performance, use React.memo for components and debounce inputs.
